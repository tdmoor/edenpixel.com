    <p>Welcome to my digital hideout. Rest your data at the viewport and take a seat near the firewall. Make yourself at home. I'm writing a <a href="https://www.bcls.lib.nj.us/genre-science-fiction" target="_blank">hard scifi</a> story and, because I'm no scientist but want my story to be scientifically rigorous, I'm using this blog to learn in public and share my process. Here's the story's premise (subject to change): A pedantic, shy man discovers he was taken from Earth as a baby and sets out to reveal the malpractices that will take down the interstellar corporation that sold him.</p>
