        <h2>Distance in space</h2>
        <p>When writing a science-fiction story, it seems important to understand distance in space. After all, space is so ridiculously large that scientists have had to come up with units of distance unknown to most earthlings today. This blog post is a summary of four concepts that I believe will be of most use in the story I'm writing:</p>

        <h3><a id="the-speed-of-light">The speed of light</a></h3>
        <p>The speed of light in a vacuum (c) is exactly <b>299,792,458 m/s</b> or, approximately, 300,000 km/s. According to our current understanding of physics, c is a constant and the maximum speed at which matter and information can travel in the universe. How did we measure this? By shooting lasers at mirrors.</p>
        <p>In 1864, James Clerk Maxwell discovered that light is an electromagnetic wave (Einstein later proved it could <i>also</i> be a particle). This was a revolutionary discovery because you can measure the speed of a wave by multiplying its frequency with its wavelength. Finally, we had a good way to measure c. In 1972, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.29.1346" target="_blank">Evenson et al.</a> published a paper that described how they had measured c with relative accuracy using laser interferometry.</p>
        <p>They had shot a laser with a known frequency into a half-silvered mirror that reflected a part of the light and let another part through. The two separate beams of light reflected to the half-silvered mirror with two fully reflective mirrors so they shared the same path once more and hit a detector.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../images/michelson-interferometer.png" alt="a Michelson interferometer" width="600" height="600" class="center">
            <figcaption>This is how Evenson et al. set up their experiment</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You can tell how separate beams of light interact with each other by their intensity. If their wavelengths interact constructively, the light intensity will be doubled. If they interact destructively, there will be no light intensity. Using that information, Evenson et al. could move the fully reflective mirrors until the two beams of light hit the detector with perfectly successive wave crests. Measuring the distance between the two wave crests would give us c.</p>
        <p>At least, kinda. Evenson et al. measured c as 299,792,456.2 ± 1.1 m/s. Argh! Not quite the constant we were hoping c to be. There were two problems. Firstly, a decimal. How unfortunate. Secondly, an error margin of 1.1 m/s. Maybe not a big deal for us plebeians, but <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2016/precise-measurements-on-earth-ensure-nasa-s-big-spacecraft-work-in-space.html" target="_blank">precision is vital</a> when you're dealing with the vastness of space.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, the error margin wasn't the fault of c. After all, as far as we know, c is a constant. It was the fault of the meter. Buckle up, because until 1983 the meter was defined as “1,650,763.73 wavelengths of radiation emitted during the transition between levels 2p10 and 5d5 of the krypton-86 atom.” Excuse me, what? Yes, that doesn't make sure to me either. So we changed it in 1983. One meter is now defined as the length traveled by light in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458 of a second.</p>
        <p>That's right, we changed the definition of the meter so c became an exact number and, even better, an integer. Finally, we had an accurate and constant measurement of the speed of light in a vacuum. Of course, c travels at different speeds depending on the medium it travels through. This is called the refractive index and you measure it by dividing c by the phase velocity of light in that medium. For example, the refractive index of ice is 1.31, which means that light travels 1.31 times slower in ice than in a vacuum.</p>
        <p><em>As a slight aside, we've only ever measured the two-way speed of light. We shot a laser one way and measured how quickly it returned. We've never experimentally proven c in one direction. For example, it's theoretically possible that c travels at half the speed in one direction and returns instantaneously. Dr. Muller explains this much better than I ever could in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k" target="_blank">this Veritasium video</a>.</em></p>
        <h3><a id="the-astronomical-unit"></a>The astronomical unit</h3>
        <p>One astronomical unit (au) is exactly <b>149,597,870,700 meters</b> or, approximately, 150 million kilometers. This is roughly the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Why is this important? Well, first of all, the Sun is the biggest celestial object in our sky and it's cool to know how far it actually is, thank you very much. Secondly, the au was essential to measure the distance between not just the Sun and the Earth, but between all celestial bodies orbiting the Sun.</p>
        <p>Back in the 17th century, Johannes Kepler had formulated three laws that enabled him to figure out the <em>relative</em> distances between the known planets at that time and the Sun. I'm posting Kepler's 1618 measurements as well as more accurate measurements taken in 2018, just to show how accurately Kepler predicted the relative distances between the planets and the Sun:</p>

        <p>So Kepler knew that Mercury was almost three times closer to the Sun than the Earth, that Mars was about half the distance away from Earth as the Earth to the Sun, that Jupiter was over five times further from the Sun than the Earth. But he didn't know how far that actually was in absolute distance. And he never would (sad) because he died in 1630 and it wasn't until the 18th century that we thought of a way to measure the distance from the Earth to the Sun.</p>
        <p>In 1716, the English astronomer Edmond Halley proposed to use the transit of Venus across the Sun to measure the Earth's distance from the Sun. The basic idea was to have two different stations on Earth, both far removed from one another, observe Venus as it moved in front of the Sun. Measuring the distance between both stations and the angular difference of Venus across the Sun (the solar parallax) would allow scientists to measure the absolute distance between Earth and Venus. Because scientists knew the relative distances between the planets, this would allow them to measure the distance between the Earth and the Sun.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Measuring the distance to the Sun</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Easier said than done. Firstly, it's hard to accurately measure the distance between two points on Earth. Secondly, the angular difference as seen from Earth is very small (the picture above is definitely not to scale). Thirdly, Venus almost never moves across the Sun so we can see it. Its last transit was in 2012 and its next transit will be in 2117. But it worked! Scientists were eventually quite accurate in measuring what ultimately became one au. If you want to dig deeper into the specific calculations, <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/venus/question4.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> explains it really well.</p>
        <p>The au is a good unit for distance inside a stellar system, but it's too small for interstellar distances. For that, we need to talk about the next two units of measurements.</p>
        <p><em>As another slight aside, now that we know c and au, we can calculate how long it takes for the Sun's light to reach the Earth. The calculation is straightforward: Because one au is 150,000,000,000 m and c is 300,000,000 m/s, it takes around 500 s for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. About eight minutes and twenty seconds. So if the Sun fizzles out, we'd only know eight minutes and twenty seconds later.</em></p>
        <h3><a id="the-light-year">The light-year</a></h3>
        <p>One light-year (ly) is exactly <b>9.4607 * 10¹⁵ meters</b>, equivalent to 63,241 au or 0.3066 pc (which we'll come back to next). It's the distance light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year. A Julian year is defined as exactly 362.25 days of 84,400 seconds because a year in the Gregorian calendar, the calendar we use today, fluctuates a little. The Julian year should not be confused with a year in the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-calendar.html" target="_blank">Julian calendar</a>.</p>
        <p>Astronomers rarely use ly because it's not part of <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/home" target="_blank">International System of Units</a> (SI). But it's a common unit in popular culture and some works of science-fiction, which is why I included it here.</p>
        <h3><a id="parsec">Parsec</a></h3>
        <p>One parsec (pc) is exactly <b>3.0857 * 10¹⁶ meters</b>, equivalent to 2.06265 * 10⁵ au or 3.26156 ly. Frank Watson Dyson wrote in his <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/73/5/334/972786" target="_blank">1913 paper</a> that the British astronomer Herbert Hall Turner first coined the term. Parsec is the preferred unit in astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
        <p>One parsec is the distance of something that has a parallax angle of one arcsecond. An arcsecond is 1/60th of an arcminute and 1/3,600th of a degree. So a tiny, tiny angle. Stretch your arm in front of you and stick out your thumb. Look at it with one eye closed and then with the other. Unless you're a cyclops, it'll seem as if your thumb jumps from left to right a little. That's parallax.</p>
        <p>We can use parallax to measure the distance to celestial bodies because the Earth moves around the Sun. The general idea is this: you look at a star and remember where it's located in space. Then you wait six months, until Earth is on the other side of the Sun, and you look at the star again. It will have moved a little bit. That's also parallax.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../images/parsec.jpg" alt="parsec explained" width="600" height="600" class="center">
            <figcaption>A basic explanation of parsec</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The closer the object, the bigger the parallax angle. That's why parsec has an inverse relationship to the parallax angle. The parsec formula is (one au) / (the parallax angle). For example, Proxima Centauri has a parallax angle of 0.76813, which means it's 1 / 0.76813 = ~1.302 pc away. Sirius has a parallax angle of 0.723, which means it's ~1.383 pc away. Despite being the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius is a good bit further away than Proxima Centauri.</p>
        <p>Astronomers use pc to measure distance within the Milky Way. They use kiloparsecs (Kpc) for more distant object, megaparsecs (Mpc) for mid-distant galaxies, and gigaparsecs (Gpc) for the most distant galaxies.</p>
        <p><em>As a final aside, Han Solo made a critical mistake in A New Hope when he said that the Millennium Falcon “<a href="https://youtu.be/fjYuw6zWk_Y?t=15" target="_blank">made the Kessel run in less than 12 pc</a>.” Parsec is a measurement of distance, not time. Sorry Star Wars fans.</em></p>
        <h3>To conclude</h3>
        <p>In this blog post, we have defined and explained the speed of light, the astronomical unit, the light-year, and parsec. There's more to each of these, and there's much more to measuring distance in space, but I believe I covered enough of the fundamentals for a layperson to have an okay grasp of how astronomers measure distance in space.</p>
